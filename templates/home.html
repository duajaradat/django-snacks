        <h4>Python</h4>
        <p>
            Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
            dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
            code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express
            concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such
            as C++ or Java.
            <br/>
            The language provides constructs intended to enable
            clear programs on both a small and large scale. It provides
            dynamic typing and has constructs that help support object-oriented
            programming.
